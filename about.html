        <p>This is the Anet A8, one of two printers I own. It's workable build area is 200mm x 200mm x 220mm. It has a heated, aluminum bed, and uses a direct-drive extruder. This printer is more geared towards large, draft prints, or prints you don't mind sanding the hell out of, as the print resolution leaves something to be desired.</p>

      <p>This is the Monoprice Mini Select V2, the other printer I own. It's workable build area is 110mm x 110mm x 110mm. It has a heated aluminum bed with an Original BuildTak printing surface. It uses a Bowden-style extruder. This printer is more geared towards smaller, detailed prints, as it's print resolution is impeccable, although it will take slightly longer to print. </p>

        This is me! My name is Aaron and I own both of the printers above. I have roughly 100 hours each in both Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360, and roughly 30 hours in Autodesk Maya. I started this business because, before I got my first 3D printer, I would see all these cool 3D printed inventions and ideas, and I was disappointed that there was no local 3D printing hubs that charged reasonable rates. So,once I got my first 3D printer, I started brainstorming, and brainstorming, until I came up with a good business model that wasn't too hard on me or my customers, and here we are! Please enjoy your stay on the site, and if you decide to purchase something, I hope you enjoy that too!
