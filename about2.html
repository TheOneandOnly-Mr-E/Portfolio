             Hi! My name is Aaron Smith, and I'm an aspiring Aerospace Engineer. To accomplish this goal, I plan to gain as much knowledge as possible about the various disciplines of engineering before I attend college. Past high school, I plan to attend Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and gain my bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering. If possible, I would like to gain an internship at an engineering firm, preferably one focused in the aerospace industry. <br><br> I posess a myriad of favorable characteristcs gained from the experiences I've had both within and outside of school. I've learned diligence and perserverance from my journey to obtain my first-degree black belt in kajukenbo, which took 7 years of training, and culminated in a 10 hour test that was both physically and mentally grueling. I'd consider myself creative, as, in my spare time, I've designed multiple orignial ideas that I'm close to bringing to reality. <br><br> I don't have much work experience, the only time that I could actually qualify as work would be the 2 years I worked as an assistant at Eleanor Murray Fallon Middle School. From that experience, I've learned how to be cautiously assertive, as in I'm assertive when the situation calls for.
